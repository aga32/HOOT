I am in the beginning stages of this project, check back in a bit to see my progress! :)

In an area where foxes and hawks are prevalent, it becomes difficult to keep our chickens safe while foraging during the day.  Most commercial motion sensor cameras send alerts for any movement within the frame which is not helpful when monitoring free-range animals.  To combat these issues, I decided to create a program to identify predators using machine learning so that I am only alerted when the chickens are in potential danger.
