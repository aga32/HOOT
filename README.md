After inheriting chickens from our home's previous owner, there has been a learning curve to caring for our new pets. Being in an area where foxes and hawks are prevalent, it becomes difficult to keep them safe while they are foraging during the day.  Most commercial motion sensor cameras send alerts for any movement within the frame which is not helpful when you are monitoring free range animals.  To combat these issues, I decided to create a program to identify a fox and hawk within the camera frame using machine learning to only be alerted when the chickens are in potential danger.
